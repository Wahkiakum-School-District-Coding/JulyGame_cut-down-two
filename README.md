This is a task in pprogress.  
It is to create a game that contestants in Science Olympiad can enter the event called "Game Agent" .. 
... and they are tasked with creating a RML game agent that can beat the game. 

There are essentially two parts, or levels:
... part 1 is much like a 2d snake game, but the snake has no tail.
... ... collec enough "power nodules" to fuel your tank in part 2
... ... press "L" to launch your tank
... part 2 is much like a lunar lander game, in 3d. 
... ... the overall goal is to safely land the tank in the landing zone at a very slow speed. 
... ... as of 7/6 I have not yet won the game as a human player, without cheating

The current Event Description will be in a second file on this git project.
